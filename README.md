### This is a repository created for a project as a part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

It will encapsulate what I have learned in terms of for the markup text HTML. It will have a website with multiple webpages, the ability to move between webpages(links), images, text and much more. It will attempt to show my understanding of various tags and their purposes. Furthermore, it will be refined with CSS later on.
