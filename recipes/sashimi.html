        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            Sashimi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish that is typically served with soy sauce and wasabi. 
            It is important to use the freshest fish possible, preferably sashimi-grade, which means it has been specifically prepared and handled to be safe to eat raw. 
            Sashimi is often served as an appetizer or as part of a larger meal in Japanese cuisine.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400-500 grams (14-18 ounces) of fresh sashimi-grade fish</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I.e. tuna, salmon, yellowtail, or mackerel</li>
                </ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Wasabi paste</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons of Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Pickled ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>Seaweed (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Fish: </strong>Begin by placing the fish in the refrigerator for about 15-30 minutes to chill it slightly. This makes it easier to slice.
                Using a sharp knife, slice the fish into thin, uniform pieces. Aim for slices that are approximately 1/4 inch thick.</li>
            <li><strong>Presenting the Sashimi: </strong>Arrange the sliced fish on a clean, chilled plate or platter. You can arrange them in a single layer or slightly overlap them for an attractive presentation.
                If desired, garnish the plate with slices of pickled ginger and a small mound of wasabi paste. You can also add a few pieces of seaweed for additional flavor and texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Serving: </strong>Serve the sashimi immediately after preparing it. It is best enjoyed fresh when the flavors and textures are at their peak.
                Provide small dishes of soy sauce and additional wasabi for dipping. Encourage guests to dip the sashimi lightly into the soy sauce and wasabi before eating to enhance the flavors without overpowering the delicate taste of the fish.</li>
        </ol>
